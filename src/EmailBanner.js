            I'm Smit Savani. I have completed my BE in computer engineering. I
            have been working as a Junior React.js Developer at BigScal
            Technologies for the past two years. Iâ€™m skilled in reactjs, as well
            as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout my working career, I've had
            the opportunity to work on diverse projects where I've improved my
            skills in front-end development, utilizing React.js to create
            responsive user interfaces. I have also worked with APIs and am
            familiar with version control programs like Git. I also pay close
            attention to details and aim to write legible, clean code.
